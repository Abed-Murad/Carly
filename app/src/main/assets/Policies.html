<p>Advantage Car &amp; Truck Rental serves many communities across Ontario, Canada. Following are
    the policies that we have regarding all car and truck rental customers.</p>
<p>The following policies apply to all locations. Please review the specific policies as needed
    before reserving your vehicle.</p>
<h2><strong>Customer Pick-Up and Drop-Off</strong></h2>
<p>We are pleased to offer this service for all of our customers. Advantage Car and Truck Rentals&rsquo;
    pick-up and drop-off services are designed to assist with the rental process, therefore this
    service is restricted within a reasonable geographical area within the city where the rental is
    to take place. Currently, customer pick-up or drop-off is limited to an area within several
    kilometer of the rental location. Any exceptions to this practice is at Advantage&rsquo;s
    discretion and the specific location&rsquo;s geographical pickup and drop off zone.</p>
<h2><strong>Rates and Price Quotations</strong></h2>
<p>Rates and prices vary greatly as with all businesses. All rates and prices are verified at the
    time of rental and the prices that are recorded on the documentation are received at the&nbsp;time
    of rental and are final, regardless of moment to moment verbal discussions.</p>

<p>Renters are allowed one hour (60 minutes) &ldquo;grace&rdquo; period upon return. If the rental
    exceeds the grace period, an hourly rate applies to a maximum of a daily rate. If the rental

    rate.</p>
